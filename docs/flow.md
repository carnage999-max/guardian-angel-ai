# Guardian Angel AI® — Narrative Flow (One Page)

Order is fixed:

1) HERO: "What is this?"
   - Product-first
   - Calm promise
   - Single CTA: How It Works

2) PROBLEM: "Why does it need to exist?"
   - Safety blind spots
   - Cameras illegal/unethical here

3) SOLUTION: "What replaces cameras?"
   - Non-recording, on-device detection
   - Zero surveillance framing

4) HOW IT WORKS: "How can it work without recording?"
   - Edge sensing → AI inference → policy evaluation → alert
   - Expandable technical panels (accordion)

5) USE CASE MATRIX: "Where does this matter?"
   - Grid + mobile snap rows
   - Each use case includes: environment → why cameras fail → fit → alert flow

6) TRUST: "Why should we believe you?"
   - Privacy & Ethics guarantees
   - Technical enforcement + auditability
   - Compliance list without badges

7) COMPANY: "Who builds this and how do we engage?"
   - Short institutional company block (mission + principles)
   - Domain + contact direction

8) CTA: "Next step"
   - Request Info / Pilot Inquiry / Institutional Contact (minimal)
   - No urgency, no countdowns, no manipulation
