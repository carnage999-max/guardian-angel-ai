Build Guardian Angel AI® as a one-page, trust-first website comparable to Anthropic/OpenAI in polish and restraint.

Primary objective:
Establish Guardian Angel AI® as privacy-preserving safety infrastructure.

Non-negotiables:
- No surveillance language.
- No camera imagery.
- No fear-based marketing.
- Calm, declarative copy.
- Institutional-grade design.
- Privacy and ethics override conversion metrics.

Domain:
Use guardianangeldevice.com in footer, metadata, and contact context where appropriate.

Tech:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Prefer CSS for motion (scroll-snap, transforms, transitions).
- Use three.js sparingly for an ambient background halo layer (non-surveillance).
- Use an advanced icon library: lucide-react (primary), optional Phosphor (secondary).
- No default trackers. Only privacy-first analytics (optional, off by default).

Layout:
Vertical narrative. Each section answers one question before the next.

Navigation (top):
How It Works, Use Cases, Trust, Company, Contact.
Mobile nav:
Push-down full-screen menu. Use an "Anthropic-like" icon (two-line or glyph, not hamburger).

Hero (first view):
- First visible element: product (3D render).
- Headline: Guardian Angel AI®
- Sub-headline: Aware, when you can’t®
- CTA: How It Works
- No autoplay media.

Cards:
Cards are required. Do not render as endless vertical list.
- Desktop: bento grids, alternating 2-col/3-col layouts.
- Mobile: use horizontal snap carousels + 2-up mini grids + staggered layouts.
Use CSS scroll-snap (no heavy JS sliders).

Performance:
TTFP <2s; Interactive <3s.
Use next/image, proper sizing, blur placeholders.

Accessibility:
WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard navigation, reduced motion.

Do not invent certifications or partnerships.
No unearned compliance badges.
