# Guardian Angel AI®

Aware, when you can’t®

Guardian Angel AI® is privacy-preserving safety infrastructure.
It exists to detect danger without recording, watching, or storing personal data.

---

## The Problem

Many environments require safety awareness,
but cameras are illegal, unethical, or inappropriate.

Bathrooms.
Locker rooms.
Homes.
Correctional facilities.
Healthcare settings.

Traditional surveillance cannot be used here.
Blind spots remain.

---

## The Solution

Guardian Angel AI® provides awareness without surveillance.

It performs on-device detection without recording audio, video, or identity.
No footage.
No storage.
No monitoring.

Only awareness, when it is needed.

## How It Works

Edge sensing  
→ On-device AI inference  
→ Policy evaluation  
→ Alert

All processing occurs locally.
No raw data leaves the device.

Expandable panels may explain:
- Sensor abstraction
- Model boundaries
- Alert thresholds
- Fail-safe behavior
